Welcome!

This document serves as a guided tutorial for our workshop on **06.03.2025** at Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus. It is designed to help you get started using the WRIC_preprocessing package, but you can use it afterwards to follow it on your own.

Before we dive into the code-along session, please ensure you have the following installed:


-  **R**: The programming language weâ€™ll be using for data analysis and visualization.
- **A Programming Environment (RStudio)**: I will demonstrate using RStudio, but feel free to use a different IDE.
- **Quarto**: To render this tutorial, if you choose to go through it by yourself.

<summary>Click here for installation links and instructions</summary>
- **[Install R](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)**
- **[Install RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)**
- **[Install Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)**

# FAQ and "Programming Terms"
### What is the difference between R and RStudio?
**R** is a programming language, while **RStudio** is a, so called, integrated development environment (IDE) designed specifically for R, offering a user-friendly interface for coding, plotting, and managing projects. You can think of R like a language, like english, where RStudio is Word - a program you can write english inside. But you could also use other programs for example libre office or latex.

### qmd vs R vs Rmd 
There are different types of files where you can write R code. A file ending in **.R** is a standard R script for writing and running R code, while in **.qmd (Quarto Document)** or **.Rmd (R Markdown)** you can combine code and text for dynamic reports, or for example this tutorial.


# Getting Started
All functions are contained in the `R/WRIC_preprocessing.R` file. But to also have access to example data, doc_strings, tutorials and HowTo's please download the entire repository for this workshop.

1. Download the entire repository from GitHub
- Go to the [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/hulmanlab/WRIC_processing) and click the **Code** button.
- Click **Download ZIP** to download the entire repository, then extract it.
If you have Git installed on your computer or GitHub Desktop, feel free to clone the repository instead of downloading it. 
`git clone https://github.com/hulmanlab/WRIC_processing.git`

2. Set your working directory
- Set your working directory in R to the downloaded WRIC_processing directory. That means your path should end in `".../WRIC_processing"`. You can check the full path, by [add info for both mac and windows]
- **Via RStudio menu:** Session -> Set Working Directory -> Choose Directory
- **Via Terminal:**
```
setwd("path/to/this/folder/WRIC_processing")
getwd() # To check the current directory
```

<details>
<summary>Why do we change the working directory</summary>
The working directory is where RStudio is looking for files. Meaning we can easily type source('R/WRIC_preprocessing.R') instead of the entire file path. There is nothing wrong with specifiying the entire file path and not changing the working directory. But for this workshop it makes it a lot easier, when we can all use the same code and this ensure that all code runs on your computer without having to change anything.

3. Importing the functions from the "package"
- `source()` runs an R script and loads its functions into your environment

```{r}
source("R/WRIC_processing.R")
```


# Preprocess WRIC data
- code chunk with example data (explain what it all does)
- now use parameteres available
- show docstring to see parameter documentation
- play with various parameters

# Batch Processing
- looping over folder with multiple files
- super quick excursion: RedCap API -> verweis auf seperates tutorial

# Automatic note file extraction - adaptation to your notes
- explain how notefile parameter works with example (e.g. necessary to create example data for that)

# Working with a subset of the data (specific time)
- example from already extracted data, import it again as dataframe
- extract certain time frame
- maybe some examplary biostats example? -> ask chatgpt for something simple

# Visualizing WRIC data


```{r}
2 + 2
```
